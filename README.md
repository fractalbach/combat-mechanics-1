# Battle Simulator Experiment

Experiments with Combat mechanics for a game.

The purpose of this experiment is to to find a balanced way to calculate damage that would create a good PvP and/or PvM experience.

The role of the simulator is to create battle scenarios and run those scenarios many times. The reason that the simulator exists is because of the usage of random numbers.  Although a usage of Probability Theory should be able to directly solve everything the simulator does, it is still fun to use a simulator.

# Goals


- 
	The battles need to be sufficiently random to be interesting, but also predictable to be fair. In other words, the lower skilled player should always have a solid chance at defeating a higher skilled player, but not enough to make the battle entirely determined by random chance.
	
- Determine which passive factors should affect the damage. (or if there should be any at all)  These are things like player stats.

- The battle should be interesting without relying on passive factors at all.  This would create a balanced and fun battle that relies purely on player skill and choice, rather than pre-existing stats attached to the player's character.

- During a fight, how does player choice affect the battle?  There needs to be enough choice to make it feel like the player earns a win, and isn't just rolling dice.
